# Apollo Server on Cloudflare workers

This is an example showing how to use the beta version of ApolloServer 2.0 with Cloudflare workers. To build your schema, edit the index.js file to match the shape of the data your application needs and connect it to backend REST endpoints. Then run `npm run build` to create a bundle that you can upload to your Cloudflare worker!

This is a super duper early testing ground so please open issues on the ApolloServer repo with ideas or PR's here for better docs üòç

### Installation

`npm install`

### Building

`npm run build`

### Uploading

Right now the UI is a great way to try it out! Long term we want to help build a CLI :)
